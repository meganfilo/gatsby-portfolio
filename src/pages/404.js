        <p>Gulp. You hold back tears as the white liquid spreads across the floor from your sad looking carton. You should have bought the chocolate milk, it was clearly the better choice. And then maybe you wouldnâ€™t have so carelessly smacked it across the room when you emphatically pointed at a bird outside. Too late now. You wipe the single tear from your eye and go fetch the mop.</p>
