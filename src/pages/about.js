        <article>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm Megan Filo, a full-stack web developer currently living in
            Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

            I originally moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2016 to start a career
            in the music business. I landed a job with a major record label that
            involved creating and maintaining e-commerce shops for artists that
            occasionally had me doing basic HTML updates and some fun graphic
            design work for social media content. At another record label gig, I
            created and maintained Shopify stores.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those tiny pieces of web development work sparked my interest and I
            was ready to learn more. After a year of late nights and weekends of
            self-study, I landed my first web developer gig in 2019. Since then,
            I have continued to learn more about many aspects of front-end and
            back-end web development and picking up new technologies when I can.
          </p>

            When I‚Äôm not staring deeply into a text editor, I‚Äôm usually playing
            video games, brewing beer, or out getting ice cream with my husband.

            I also play drums ü•Å. You can catch me playing around the southern
            U.S. with a badass artist named{" "}
